SO,now front end is quite basic where only one component has been used and it has been injected in router. File axios.js is intercepting axios call and I have simply gave my base url route there, If your API is served on any other port and url then you can change it there. For UI bootstrap-vue has been used, all the UI return code are been drived from Bootstrap-vue -v 3. This is a vue js 2, so the packages are been used according to it.

Basically in this project you can add your events, edit it and then delete it. You need to add your event title, description, start_date and end_date. This project also has a filter feature where you can filter events on the basis of its status.
